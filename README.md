#  Hi team waterfall,
#  
# On 24/09/2025 we discovered the following process :)
# Please see commit history to see that I have cleaned up the main branch.
# If you are not on the 'Pull requests' list, please try to do this quickly so we can complete the activity.
#
# 1) Please tell me your GitHub username, wait for me to invite you to the project collaborators
# 
# [Enter the following as commands in your Git Repo terminal]:
# 
# mkdir github      (or another folder name you will remember)
#     (this will make a new folder to avoid issues with our old work, ignoring your old git init
#      we spent a lot of time troubleshooting yesterday and this was the simple quick fix)
#      another solution is to remove your local files and local .git repo, or to mkdir a new folder
#      within your old one, and cd newfolder , until your GitRepo shows you are in a new one.
#
#    *There is no need to 'git init' when you are cloning a github repo - it will bring its own .git*
#
#
#
# git clone https://github.com/bumbullbean/waterfall.git
# 
# git checkout -b feature/Your_name
#        this(makes your branch and puts you in it)
#        please write it as feature/your-name as the feature/ will then be consistent with everyone
# 
# > Yourname.txt
#        this makes a text file, e.g. Joe.txt
#        then vi Yourname.txt
#        edit, save :wq ,
#
#          or use       echo "# Contents of your bio" > Yourname.txt
#          if you don't want to use vim editor
# 
# git add Yourname.txt
# 
# git commit -m "I added my txt"
# 
# git push origin yourbranchname
#     e.g  
#       git push origin feature/joe
#
#    You will be unable to 'git push' unless you have added and committed it from your seperate branch from main.
#    ---------------------------------------------------------
#    When done successfully, this will
#    ---------------------------------------------------------
#    Open in browser, you might have to authenticate or link your GitRepo local to your Github online account if not yet done
#    Please fill out 'pull request' form on Github (online on this website) and submit.
#    Then we will be able to merge with the project from the list of Pull Requests as the activity has called for :D
